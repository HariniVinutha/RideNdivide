**PROJECT DESCRIPTION**

Ride N Divide is an android application that facilitates carpooling. This acts as a platform for people with similar commute plans 
to collaborate and share a ride. Carpool hosts can post their commute plans. It allows passengers looking for rides to sift through 
posted commute plans and choose the one that suits them the best. Passengers can then call the carpool hosts at a click of a button 
to discuss and confirm ride details. Why not use it, when it can save your time, money and of course the planet Earth! 


-Application is written in Java
-Application uses Autocomplete API and Places API, Powered by GOOGLE.

**FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS**

Currently the application uses a local SQLite database as a backend. In future, we plan to set up a remote server for the database. 

We also plan to incorporate a rating system where users sharing a ride can rate one another on the carpooling experience. We hope
to use this data to provide improved and customized search results. 

Going forward, users shall also be provided with an option to choose the gender of the fellow passengers.

We are also looking to provide an option to log Periodic/Repetitive commute plans that will help manage regular carpooling events. 

Further more, the application shall support other modes of communication such as chat and email.
